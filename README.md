# 🐎 BackToLay Ponies

A data-driven **in-play trading assistant** for Betfair horse racing markets.  
Designed to identify **high-probability DOB (Double or Bust)** horses — the kind that dash to the front and slice their odds in half while running!

## 🔍 What Is a "DOB"?

> **DOB** = Double Or Bust  
Back a horse before the off, lay it at half the price in-play.  
If the price drops, you win both trades — zero risk, sweet profit.  
It doesn't need to win — just run like a beast for a bit.

- 📉 Highlights profitable DOB trends from historical data
